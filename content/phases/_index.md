## Main Project Goals & Phases

We have currently set out to achieve the following four goals:

1. Digitize and catalog tribal materials (e.g., papers, videos, photos, notes), 
2. Create guides and curriculum for developing local capacities and data literacies related to digital archiving, including cataloging metadata and using existing online archival tools,
3. Design and test a digital archiving workflow that is specifically created for Inuit communities to maintain and  access community databases, and
4. Develop a protocol for Indigenous data and research sovereignty to protect community knowledges and practices.
