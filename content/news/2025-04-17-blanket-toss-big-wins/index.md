Post originally by Cana Uluak Itchuaqiyaq for [Respectful Research](https://respectfulresearch.com/).

Last Friday, something beautiful happened.

Our article, Decolonizing Community-Engaged Research: Designing CER with Cultural Humility as a Foundational Value, received the 2025 CCCC Best Article in the Philosophy or Theory of Technical and Scientific Communication Award.

The article was written by Cana Uluak Itchuaqiyaq (Virginia Tech), Corina Qaaƒ°raq Kramer ([Respectful Research](https://respectfulresearch.com/), Mumik Consulting), and [Chris Lindgren](https://clndgrn.com) (North Carolina State University). It‚Äôs rooted in our experiences with the Rematriation Project and offers a framework for community-engaged research (CER) based on cultural humility‚Äîand on the Inuit practice of nalukataq.

## üåø From the Land: Nalukataq as Research Practice

Nalukataq‚Äîthe I√±upiat blanket toss‚Äîis a celebration of community, survival, and reciprocity. But it‚Äôs also a discipline.

It takes many people to pull the walrus-skin blanket in sync. One person acts as the **caller**, watching closely and guiding the group. The **pullers** set their feet, lean back, and follow the rhythm‚Äînot their own strength. When they move together, the **jumper** is lifted into the air, able to see far and return with perspective. But if the pullers act out of sync, or ignore the caller, someone could get hurt.

This is the framework we shared in our article.
Because research‚Äîwhen it‚Äôs done well in Indigenous communities‚Äîis also a kind of nalukataq.

Researchers must learn to **pull evenly**, not dominate.
They must **listen to the caller**, not just extract from the community.
They must **stay in sync**‚Äîeven when the rhythm changes.
And they must **prepare to let go**, when the community is ready to lead fully.

That‚Äôs what cultural humility looks like in motion.

## üèõÔ∏è From the Institutions: What This Recognition Means

We don‚Äôt often see national awards in research theory go to articles that begin with Indigenous community leadership.

We don‚Äôt often see articles recognized where a community partner like Corina isn‚Äôt just cited, but co-authors, co-directs, and co-frames the research and theory itself.

And we don‚Äôt often see I√±upiaq Values used as a model for research leadership in the Arctic.

So yes‚Äîwe‚Äôre celebrating. :)

But we‚Äôre also naming what this article made visible:

Corina has long been an I√±upiaq scholar‚Äîdeeply engaged in cultural leadership, community advocacy, and language revitalization. She‚Äôs been included on academic publications before, but this was the first time she was involved from the very beginning: shaping the concept, co-developing the framework, and co-writing the article through every stage of revision and publication. This wasn‚Äôt token inclusion or late-stage feedback. This was authorship‚Äîrooted in knowledge, accountability, and voice.

And since then, the Rematriation Project, has deepened our commitment to writing with our community partners, not just about them. Together, we‚Äôve co-authored two academic articles with Avi√±√±aq Lucy Boyd and Paisaq Dylan Itchuaqiyaq of Aqqaluk Trust in Kotzebue, Alaska.

And... one of those was published online today (HOORAY!):‚Äã

  - **Abstract**: This article introduces the Relational Approach to Archiving (RAA) as a vital framework to combat the issues posed by data colonialism in traditional archival practices. RAA emphasizes the active involvement of communities in the archival process, ensuring that their cultural knowledge and values guide how materials are preserved and described. The article begins by exploring the challenges of data colonialism and the risks and opportunities of machine-learning technologies in archiving. It then presents RAA as a solution that prioritizes community agency and cultural sensitivity, while also discussing how new technologies can empower community-run archives with careful oversight.

It‚Äôs another step in this movement toward rematriation.
