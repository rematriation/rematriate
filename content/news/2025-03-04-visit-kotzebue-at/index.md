Lindgren visited Kotzebue at the end of February 2025. He and the team wanted to touch base and support Aqqaluk Trust's (AT) work within the community during a very busy and fun time of year in Kotzebue—the regional basketball tournament! The tournament is a great time to visit Kotzebue, since many folks from around the region's 11 other villages travel there to support their teams. While there, Lindgren supported Aqqaluk Trust's work with the community by fielding AT's table at the school's Career & Resource Fair and AT's table on display during the second day of the basketball tournament at the high school.

During this time, he was able to connect with AT directors and staff, show off a little prepared demo of a prototype mobile digital archive experience to some folks, and talk about what spaces, events, and places the team might develop workshops related to desired trade skills like data literacies. 

He was thankful for his time in the schools during this trip, so he could meet and talk with kids, educators, and parents from across the region during the fair and tournament. During the Career and Resource Fair, he had fun helping AT's Lucy Aviññaq Boyd, Denise Taksruq Koutchak, and Frances Qalukisaq Swanson poll kids and adults what their favorite Ińupiat Iļitqusiat value is right now, and why. This activity really helped create some conversation with the kids and adults from across the region.
