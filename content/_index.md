In partnership with a team of scholars (itself led by an IÃ±upiaq scholar from Kotzebue) from Virginia Tech and North Carolina State University, the goal of this project is to empower Indigenous communities through the lens of Indigenous data and research sovereignty to collect, control, interpret, and benefit from data that originates from their communities. The Rematriation Project operates on a foundation of community-first, community-led decision making that emphasizes Indigenous Data Sovereignty practices.
