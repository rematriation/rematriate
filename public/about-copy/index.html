  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>IÃ±upiat have specific scientific knowledges of our homeland and its changes over time that complement and extend western science. We have this traditional knowledge documented in various ways and stored in homes, schools, and organizational buildings. However, these collections are scattered and at risk of loss from housing and building insecurity, deteriorating infrastructure, mold, inadequate storage, and environmental crises. Making accessible digital versions of these knowledges is imperative. Creating digital archives is one part of the solution, increasing local capacities for digital archiving and data literacies is another.</p>
