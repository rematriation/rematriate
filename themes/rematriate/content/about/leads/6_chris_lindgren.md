bio: >-
   Chris is originally from a family farm just north of Fargo, North Dakota—lands stolen by his white-settler ancestors from Ashinabek Nation and Dakota-Lakota-Nakota Nation. He is honored to be invited to join REMA's efforts in developing self-determined digital technologies designed for social justice and Indigenous Data Sovereignty. He brings his specialities in communicating with data, computer coding, and digital technologies to help design the online interface and help coordinate other technological aspects of this project, such as testing the interface with Inuit users.
