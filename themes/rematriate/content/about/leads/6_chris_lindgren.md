bio: >-
   Chris is originally from a family farm just north of Fargo, North Dakota—ancestral lands of the Ashinabek Nation and Dakota-Lakota-Nakota Nation. He's excited to share his joy for learning about data with the communities in the NANA region, and learn more about how data can support their self-determination. He brings his specialities in communicating with data, computer coding, and digital technologies to help design the online interface and help coordinate other technological aspects of this project.
